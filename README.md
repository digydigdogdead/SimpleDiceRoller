# SimpleDiceRoller for Android
Simple Dice Roller is an android app that you can use to generate random numbers and simulate any of the 7 dice in a standard set of RPG dice. It also allows you to generate dice of any number of sides.
I use dice rolling apps on my phone frequently, and am often frustrated by how long they take to launch (usually due to using complicated engines like Unity for such a simple task, or ads) and how long they can take to use (long animations). So, I decided to learn some basic MAUI and make the lightweight app I've been looking for myself.

## Features
- Add a common die by clicking its button on the top of the screen. It will roll a value and be added to the die grid.
- Add a custom die by clicking the "D?" button and entering the number of sides you'd like it to have.
- Reroll a die by tapping it.
- Remove a die from the grid by tapping the "X" in the top right of the die.
- Add as many dice as you like! Most screens will fit 16 dice, but if for some reason you want more than that at once, then the app will let you scroll to keep up with as many dice as you've added.
- Clear all dice you've added by clicking the "Clear All" button at the bottom of the screen
